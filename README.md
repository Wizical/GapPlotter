# GapPlotter
GapPlotter is a Python package for analyzing and visualizing gaps in DNA sequence alignments stored in BAM format. It provides two scripts:

1. `gapplotter_generate_csv.py`: This script generates a CSV file containing information about gaps in a BAM file. It identifies regions of the reference genome that are not covered by any read and records them as gaps, including their start and end positions.

2. `gapplotter_generate_histogram.py`: This script generates a histogram image of gap lengths from a CSV file generated by GapPlotter. It plots the distribution of gap lengths, allowing users to visualize the frequency and distribution of gaps in the alignment data.

GapPlotter is useful for researchers working with DNA sequence data who need to analyze and visualize regions of the genome that are not covered by reads, such as gaps in sequence coverage or alignment errors.

## Features
- Generate CSV files of gap information from BAM files
- Visualize gap lengths using histogram plots
- Command-line interface for easy usage
- Compatible with Python 3.x

## Installation
To install GapPlotter, simply clone the repository.
